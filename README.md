Project description:

One of the most dangerous vulnerabilities in the web application is SQL injection. Until now many different techniques are proposed by researchers to defeat it. However attackers always found a new method to bypass these solutions. In this project, SQL injection attack had been performed using DVWA (Damn Vulnerable web application) and achieved our target that is retrieving the password by decryption of the password hash.

Prevntive measures:
First and foremost important thing
when it comes to prevent any kind
of attacks mainly SQL injection
attack is the proper Form Validation.

• When you validate properly.
Unnecessary characters and alpha
numericals can be avoided from
code injection attacks

• Always ensure before clicking any
link. This is the first step for the
attacker. The attacker may trick you
into malicious website which is
poorly coded and provides more
way for vulnerability.

• Beware of Spam messages ,most of
them are included in fraudulent
activities which will be performed
by the hackers.They make trick you
into their website and attempting
you to provide login details .

• But Spam messages can be avoided
using spam detection which can be
implemented with Naive baye's
classifier.

• Prefer always HTTPS site which
means the site is completely secure
and there is no way for vulnerability
since the security level is high.
